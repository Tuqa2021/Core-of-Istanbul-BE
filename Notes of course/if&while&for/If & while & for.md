If:  do a specific statement
if conditional test/true:
	do something
else:
do something else
Note: the indentation error because we have extra space
to take the value from user 
age = int ( input 'enter a number')
flags : every condition is true I can add it to flags
we can make a condition like string we but ' the result after that we but the condition' like string text 
list comprehension put all condition in a list
pass statement to change the if statement later
while true:
do something then repeat until condition is false
why use a break statement? when find the true of condition go out side the loop and don't continue
for :iterate through iterable 
if I use tuple I need to use enumerate in condition and when I print i can print  the index & the tuple and if I use dictionary i have to use enumerate and give it dictionary. Value() but i have to put it in a list  or items
continue that means still in the loop until finish
to count the words in a text you can use for loop and if condition or you can call a library module collections 
called like this from collections import Counter
